ðŸŽ¬ CineMatch-Personalized-Movie-Recommender-System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System, a Python and Machine Learning project that enhances your movie-watching experience by delivering personalized movie recommendations. This system intelligently combines Content-Based Filtering using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Collaborative Filtering powered by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Dual Filtering: Leverages the strengths of both Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering for superior recommendations.
Scalable: Built on the robust MovieLens dataset, a benchmark standard for recommender systems.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to other datasets or filtering methods.

ðŸ›  Dependencies
Python: Version 3.6 or above
NumPy: Fast numerical computations
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning tools and algorithms

ðŸ“Š Dataset
This project uses the MovieLens dataset, a comprehensive collection of movie ratings, user profiles, and movie metadata. It's the go-to dataset for benchmarking movie recommender systems.
